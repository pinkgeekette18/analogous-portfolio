<h3>Meet Candice, our baker.</h3>
<div>
<p>When she was little, baking in the kitchen with her mom inspired Candice to grow up and become an avid baker herself. As years passed Candice, completed college with a degree in Apparel and Textile Design and was searching for a career she could be passionate about. A few jobs later, something was lacking. After bringing in a few homemade treats and goodies to work, people were hooked. Candice and her then realized that they could help turn her dream of baking everyday into a reality. Friends and family became her official taste testers and helped guide her along the way. Utilizing the skills from her childhood, Candice bakes treats that not only taste amazing but look just as good. Only using the freshest ingredients, Candice mends high fashion with good taste! </p>
